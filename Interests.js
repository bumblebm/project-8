              <p>Apart from being a web developer and mechanical engineer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an football player  and played for state level football in school. During the warmer months here in belgaum, I enjoy doing trips, playing cricket, and video games.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow football matches and fantasy genre shows on netfilx, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring foods.</p>
